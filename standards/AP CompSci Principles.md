###### CRD-2.J.3: Program requirements are needed to identify appropriate defined inputs for testing.


## Big Idea 2: Data (DAT)

### DAT-1: The way a computer represents data internally is different from the way the data are interpreted and displayed for the user. Programs are used to translate data into a representation more easily understood by people.

#### Topic 2.1: Binary Numbers

##### DAT-1.A: Explain how data can be represented using bits.

###### DAT-1.A.1: Data values can be stored in variables, lists of items, or standalone constants and can be passed as input to (or output from) procedures.

###### DAT-1.A.2: Computing devices represent data digitally, meaning that the lowest-level components of any value are bits.

###### DAT-1.A.3: Bit is shorthand for binary digit and is either 0 or 1.

###### DAT-1.A.4: A byte is 8 bits.

###### DAT-1.A.5: Abstraction is the process of reducing complexity by focusing on the main idea. By hiding details irrelevant to the question at hand and bringing together related and useful details, abstraction reduces complexity and allows one to focus on the idea.

###### DAT-1.A.6: Bits are grouped to represent abstractions. These abstractions include, but are not limited to, numbers, characters, and color.

###### DAT-1.A.7: The same sequence of bits may represent different types of data in different contexts.

###### DAT-1.A.8: Analog data have values that change smoothly, rather than in discrete intervals, over time. Some examples of analog data include pitch and volume of music, colors of a painting, or position of a sprinter during a race.

###### DAT-1.A.9: The use of digital data to approximate real-world analog data is an example of abstraction.

###### DAT-1.A.10: Analog data can be closely approximated digitally using a sampling technique, which means measuring values of the analog signal at regular intervals called samples. The samples are measured to figure out the exact bits required to store each sample.

##### DAT-1.B: Explain the consequences of using bits to represent data.

###### DAT-1.B.1: In many programming languages, integers are represented by a fixed number of bits, which limits the range of integer values and mathematical operations on those values. This limitation can result in overflow or other errors.

###### DAT-1.B.2: Other programming languages provide an abstraction through which the size of representable integers is limited only by the size of the computer's memory; this is the case for the language defined in the exam reference sheet.

###### DAT-1.B.3: In programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers limits the range and mathematical operations on these values; this limitation can result in round-off and other errors. Some real numbers are represented as approximations in computer storage. (Specific range limitations for real numbers are outside the scope of this course and the AP Exam.)

##### DAT-1.C: For binary numbers: a. Calculate the binary (base 2) equivalent of a positive integer (base 10) and vice versa. b. Compare and order binary numbers.

###### DAT-1.C.1: Number bases, including binary and decimal, are used to represent data.

###### DAT-1.C.2: Binary (base 2) uses only combinations of the digits zero and one.

###### DAT-1.C.3: Decimal (base 10) uses only combinations of the digits 0 – 9.

###### DAT-1.C.4: As with decimal, a digit's position in the binary sequence determines its numeric value. The numeric value is equal to the bit's value (0 or 1) multiplied by the place value of its position.

###### DAT-1.C.5: The place value of each position is determined by the base raised to the power of the position. Positions are numbered starting at the rightmost position with 0 and increasing by 1 for each subsequent position to the left.

#### Topic 2.2: Data Compression

##### DAT-1.D: Compare data compression algorithms to determine which is best in a particular context.

###### DAT-1.D.1: Data compression can reduce the size (number of bits) of transmitted or stored data.

###### DAT-1.D.2: Fewer bits does not necessarily mean less information.

###### DAT-1.D.3: The amount of size reduction from compression depends on both the amount of redundancy in the original data representation and the compression algorithm applied.

###### DAT-1.D.4: Lossless data compression algorithms can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data.

###### DAT-1.D.5: Lossy data compression algorithms can significantly reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approximation of the original data.

###### DAT-1.D.6: Lossy data compression algorithms can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted more than lossless compression algorithms.

###### DAT-1.D.7: In situations where quality or ability to reconstruct the original is maximally important, lossless compression algorithms are typically chosen.

###### DAT-1.D.8: In situations where minimizing data size or transmission time is maximally important, lossy compression algorithms are typically chosen.

### DAT-2: Programs can be used to process data, which allows users to discover information and create new knowledge.

#### Topic 2.3: Extracting Information from Data

##### DAT-2.A: Describe what information can be extracted from data.

###### DAT-2.A.1: Information is the collection of facts and patterns extracted from data.

###### DAT-2.A.2: Data provide opportunities for identifying trends, making connections, and addressing problems.

###### DAT-2.A.3: Digitally processed data may show correlation between variables. A correlation found in data does not necessarily indicate that a causal relationship exists. Additional research is needed to understand the exact nature of the relationship.

###### DAT-2.A.4: Often, a single source does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion. It may be necessary to combine data from a variety of sources to formulate a conclusion.

##### DAT-2.B: Describe what information can be extracted from metadata.

###### DAT-2.B.1: Metadata are data about data. For example, the piece of data may be an image, while the metadata may include the date of creation or the file size of the image.

###### DAT-2.B.2: Changes and deletions made to metadata do not change the primary data.

###### DAT-2.B.3: Metadata are used for finding, organizing, and managing information.

###### DAT-2.B.4: Metadata can increase the effective use of data or data sets by providing additional information.

###### DAT-2.B.5: Metadata allow data to be structured and organized.

##### DAT-2.C: Identify the challenges associated with processing data.

###### DAT-2.C.1: The ability to process data depends on the capabilities of the users and their tools.

###### DAT-2.C.2: Data sets pose challenges regardless of size, such as: the need to clean data, incomplete data, invalid data, the need to combine data sources.

###### DAT-2.C.3: Depending on how data were collected, they may not be uniform. For example, if users enter data into an open field, the way they choose to abbreviate, spell, or capitalize something may vary from user to user.

###### DAT-2.C.4: Cleaning data is a process that makes the data uniform without changing their meaning (e.g., replacing all equivalent abbreviations, spellings, and capitalizations with the same word).

###### DAT-2.C.5: Problems of bias are often created by the type or source of data being collected. Bias is not eliminated by simply collecting more data.

###### DAT-2.C.6: The size of a data set affects the amount of information that can be extracted from it.

###### DAT-2.C.7: Large data sets are difficult to process using a single computer and may require parallel systems.

###### DAT-2.C.8: Scalability of systems is an important consideration when working with data sets, as the computational capacity of a system affects how data sets can be processed and stored.

#### Topic 2.4: Using Programs with Data

##### DAT-2.D: Extract information from data using a program.

###### DAT-2.D.1: Programs can be used to process data to acquire information.

###### DAT-2.D.2: Tables, diagrams, text, and other visual tools can be used to communicate insight and knowledge gained from data.

###### DAT-2.D.3: Search tools are useful for efficiently finding information.

###### DAT-2.D.4: Data filtering systems are important tools for finding information and recognizing patterns in data.

###### DAT-2.D.5: Programs such as spreadsheets help efficiently organize and find trends in information.

###### DAT-2.D.6: Some processes that can be used to extract or modify information from data include the following: transforming every element of a data set, such as doubling every element in a list, or adding a parent's email to every student record; filtering a data set, such as keeping only the positive numbers from a list, or keeping only students who signed up for band from a record of all the students; combining or comparing data in some way, such as adding up a list of numbers, or finding the student who has the highest GPA; visualizing a data set through a chart, graph, or other visual representation.

##### DAT-2.E: Explain how programs can be used to gain insight and knowledge from data.

###### DAT-2.E.1: Programs are used in an iterative and interactive way when processing information to allow users to gain insight and knowledge about data.

###### DAT-2.E.2: Programmers can use programs to filter and clean digital data, thereby gaining insight and knowledge.

###### DAT-2.E.3: Combining data sources, clustering data, and classifying data are parts of the process of using programs to gain insight and knowledge from data.

###### DAT-2.E.4: Insight and knowledge can be obtained from translating and transforming digitally represented information.

###### DAT-2.E.5: Patterns can emerge when data are transformed using programs.


## Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming (AAP)

### AAP-1: To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers represent and organize data in multiple ways.

#### Topic 3.1: Variables and Assignments

##### AAP-1.A: Represent a value with a variable.

###### AAP-1.A.1: A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values.

###### AAP-1.A.2: Using meaningful variable names helps with the readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables.

###### AAP-1.A.3: Some programming languages provide types to represent data, which are referenced using variables. These types include numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings.

###### AAP-1.A.4: Some values are better suited to representation using one type of datum rather than another.

##### AAP-1.B: Determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment.

###### AAP-1.B.1: The assignment operator allows a program to change the value represented by a variable.

###### AAP-1.B.2: The exam reference sheet provides the "←" operator to use for assignment. For example, Text: a ← expression Block: a ← expression evaluates expression and then assigns a copy of the result to the variable a.

###### AAP-1.B.3: The value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned. For example: a ← 1 b ← a a ← 2 display(b) still displays 1.

#### Topic 3.2: Data Abstraction

##### AAP-1.C: Represent a list or string using a variable.

###### AAP-1.C.1: A list is an ordered sequence of elements. For example, [value1, value2, value3, ...] describes a list where value1 is the first element, value2 is the second element, value3 is the third element, and so on.

###### AAP-1.C.2: An element is an individual value in a list that is assigned a unique index.

###### AAP-1.C.3: An index is a common method for referencing the elements in a list or string using natural numbers.

##### AAP-1.D: For data abstraction: a. Develop data abstraction using lists to store multiple elements. b. Explain how the use of data abstraction manages complexity in program code.

###### AAP-1.D.1: Data abstraction provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation.

###### AAP-1.D.2: Data abstractions manage complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without referencing the specific details of the representation.

###### AAP-1.D.3: Data abstractions can be created using lists.

###### AAP-1.D.4: Developing a data abstraction to implement in a program can result in a program that is easier to develop and maintain.

###### AAP-1.D.5: Data abstractions often contain different types of elements.

###### AAP-1.D.6: The use of lists allows multiple related items to be treated as a single value. Lists are referred to by different names, such as array, depending on the programming language.

###### AAP-1.D.7: The exam reference sheet provides the notation [value1, value2, value3, ...] to create a list with those values as the first, second, third, and so on items. For example, § Text: aList ← [value1, value2, value3, ...] Block: aList ← valuel, value2, value3 creates a new list that contains the values value1, value2, value3, and ... at indices 1, 2, 3, and ... respectively and assigns it to aList. §§ Text: aList ← [] Block: aList ← creates a new empty list and assigns it to aList.

###### AAP-1.D.8: The exam reference sheet describes a list structure whose index values are 1 through the number of elements in the list, inclusive. For all list operations, if a list index is less than 1 or greater than the length of the list, an error message is produced and the program will terminate.

### AAP-2: The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.

#### Topic 3.3: Mathematical Expressions

##### AAP-2.A: Express an algorithm that uses sequencing without using a programming language.

###### AAP-2.A.1: An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task.

##### AAP-2.B: Represent a step-by-step algorithmic process using sequential code statements.

###### AAP-2.B.1: Sequencing is the application of each step of an algorithm in the order in which the code statements are given.

###### AAP-2.B.2: A code statement is a part of program code that expresses an action to be carried out.

###### AAP-2.B.3: An expression can consist of a value, a variable, an operator, or a procedure call that returns a value.

###### AAP-2.B.4: Expressions are evaluated to produce a single value.

###### AAP-2.B.5: The evaluation of expressions follows a set order of operations defined by the programming language.

###### AAP-2.B.6: Sequential statements execute in the order they appear in the code segment.

###### AAP-2.B.7: Clarity and readability are important considerations when expressing an algorithm in a programming language.

##### AAP-2.C: Evaluate expressions that use arithmetic operators.

###### AAP-2.C.1: Arithmetic operators are part of most programming languages and include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operators.

###### AAP-2.C.2: The exam reference sheet provides a MOD b, which evaluates to the remainder when a is divided by b. Assume that a is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and b is an integer greater than 0. For example, 17 MOD 5 evaluates to 2.

###### AAP-2.C.3: The exam reference sheet provides the arithmetic operators +, -, *, /, and MOD. Text and Block: §a + b §§ a – b §§ a * b §§ a / b § a MOD b These are used to perform arithmetic on a and b. For example, 17 / 5 evaluates to 3.4.

###### AAP-2.C.4: The order of operations used in mathematics applies when evaluating expressions. The MOD operator has the same precedence as the * and / operators.

#### Topic 3.4: Strings

##### AAP-2.D: Evaluate expressions that manipulate strings.

###### AAP-2.E.2: The exam reference sheet provides the following relational operators: =, ≠, >, <, ≥, and ≤. Text and Block: §§ a = b §§ a ≠ b §§ a > b §§ a < b §§ a ≥ b §§ a ≤ b These are used to test the relationship between two variables, expressions, or values. A comparison using a relational operator evaluates to a Boolean value. For example, a = b evaluates to true if a and b are equal; otherwise, it evaluates to false.

##### AAP-2.F: For relationships between Boolean values: a. Write expressions using logical operators. b. Evaluate expressions that use logic operators.

###### AAP-2.F.1: The exam reference sheet provides the logical operators NOT, AND, and OR, which evaluate to a Boolean value.

###### AAP-2.F.4: The exam reference sheet provides Text: condition1 OR condition2 Block: condition1 OR condition2 which evaluates to true if condition1 is true or if condition2 is true or if both condition1 and condition2 are true; otherwise it evaluates to false.

###### AAP-2.F.5: The operand for a logical operator is either a Boolean expression or a single Boolean value.

#### Topic 3.6: Conditionals

##### AAP-2.G: Express an algorithm that uses selection without using a programming language.

###### AAP-2.G.1: Selection determines which parts of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false.

##### AAP-2.H: For selection: a. Write conditional statements. b. Determine the result of conditional statements.

###### AAP-2.H.1: Conditional statements, or "if-statements," affect the sequential flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression.

###### AAP-2.H.2: The exam reference sheet provides Text: IF(condition) { block of statements } Block: IF condition block of statements in which the code in block of statements is executed if the Boolean expression condition evaluates to true; no action is taken if condition evaluates to false.

###### AAP-2.H.3: The exam reference sheet provides Text: IF(condition) { first block of statements } ELSE { second block of statements } Block: IF condition first block of statements ELSE second block of statements in which the code in first block of statements is executed if the Boolean expression condition evaluates to true; otherwise, the code in second block of statements is executed.

###### AAP-2.K.3: The exam reference sheet provides Text: REPEAT UNTIL(condition) { block of statements } Block: REPEAT UNTIL condition block of statements in which the code in block of statements is repeated until the Boolean expression condition evaluates to true.

###### AAP-2.K.4: In REPEAT UNTIL(condition) iteration, an infinite loop occurs when the ending condition will never evaluate to true.

###### AAP-2.K.5: In REPEAT UNTIL(condition) iteration, if the conditional evaluates to true initially, the loop body is not executed at all, due to the condition being checked before the loop.

#### Topic 3.9: Developing Algorithms

##### AAP-2.L: Compare multiple algorithms to determine if they yield the same side effect or result.

###### AAP-2.L.1: Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks.

###### AAP-2.O.5: Linear search or sequential search algorithms check each element of a list, in order, until the desired value is found or all elements in the list have been checked.

#### Topic 3.11: Binary Search

##### AAP-2.P: For binary search algorithms: a. Determine the number of iterations required to find a value in a data set. b. Explain the requirements necessary to complete a binary search.

###### AAP-2.P.1: The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of a sorted data set of numbers and eliminates half of the data; this process repeats until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated.

###### AAP-2.P.2: Data must be in sorted order to use the binary search algorithm.

###### AAP-2.P.3: Binary search is often more efficient than sequential/linear search when applied to sorted data.

### AAP-3: Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused.

###### AAP-3.A.3: Parameters are input variables of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called.

###### AAP-3.A.4: A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements, causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. Once the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow of control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called.

###### AAP-3.A.5: The exam reference sheet provides procName(arg1, arg2, ...) as a way to call Text: PROCEDURE procName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) { block of statements } Block: PROCEDURE procName parameter1, parameter2,... block of statements which takes zero or more arguments; arg1 is assigned to parameter1, arg2 is assigned to parameter2, and so on.

###### AAP-3.B.3: The subdivision of a computer program into separate subprograms is called modularity.

###### AAP-3.B.4: A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program code reuse, which helps manage complexity.

###### AAP-3.B.5: Using parameters allows procedures to be generalized, enabling the procedures to be reused with a range of input values or arguments.

###### AAP-3.B.6: Using procedural abstraction helps improve code readability.

###### AAP-3.B.7: Using procedural abstraction in a program allows programmers to change the internals of the procedure (to make it faster, more efficient, use less storage, etc.) without needing to notify users of the change as long as what the procedure does is preserved.

##### AAP-3.C: Develop procedural abstractions to manage complexity in a program by writing procedures.

###### AAP-3.C.1: The exam reference sheet provides Text: PROCEDURE procName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) { block of statements } Block: PROCEDURE procName parameter1, parameter2,... block of statements which is used to define a procedure that takes zero or more arguments. The procedure contains block of statements.

###### AAP-3.C.2: The exam reference sheet provides Text: PROCEDURE procName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) { block of statements RETURN(expression) } Block: PROCEDURE procName parameter1, parameter2,... block of statements RETURN expression which is used to define a procedure that takes zero or more arguments.

###### AAP-3.F.4: The process of developing an abstract simulation involves removing specific details or simplifying functionality.

###### AAP-3.F.5: Simulations can contain bias derived from the choices of real-world elements that were included or excluded.

###### AAP-3.F.6: Simulations are most useful when real-world events are impractical for experiments (e.g., too big, too small, too fast, too slow, too expensive, or too dangerous).

###### AAP-3.F.7: Simulations facilitate the formulation and refinement of hypotheses related to the objects or phenomena under consideration.

###### AAP-3.F.8: Random number generators can be used to simulate the variability that exists in the real world.

###### AAP-4.A.2: A decision problem is a problem with a yes/no answer (e.g., is there a path from A to B?). An optimization problem is a problem with the goal of finding the "best" solution among many (e.g., what is the shortest path from A to B?).

###### AAP-4.A.3: Efficiency is an estimation of the amount of computational resources used by an algorithm. Efficiency is typically expressed as a function of the size of the input.

###### AAP-4.A.4: An algorithm's efficiency is determined through formal or mathematical reasoning.

###### AAP-4.A.5: An algorithm's efficiency can be informally measured by determining the number of times a statement or group of statements executes.

###### AAP-4.A.6: Different correct algorithms for the same problem can have different efficiencies.

###### AAP-4.A.7: Algorithms with a polynomial efficiency or slower (constant, linear, square, cube, etc.) are said to run in a reasonable amount of time. Algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies are examples of algorithms that run in an unreasonable amount of time.

###### AAP-4.A.8: Some problems cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time because there is no efficientalgorithm for solving them. In these cases, approximate solutions are sought.

###### AAP-4.A.9: A heuristic is an approach to a problem that produces a solution that is not guaranteed to be optimal but may be used when techniques that are guaranteed to always find an optimal solution are impractical.

#### Topic 3.18: Undecidable Problems

##### AAP-4.B: Explain the existence of undecidable problems in computer science.

###### AAP-4.B.1: A decidable problem is a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct output for all inputs (e.g., "Is the number even?").

###### AAP-4.B.2: An undecidable problem is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer.

###### AAP-4.B.3: An undecidable problem may have some instances that have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem.

###### CSN-1.E.2: Redundancy is the inclusion of extra components that can be used to mitigate failure of a system if other components fail.

###### CSN-1.E.3: One way to accomplish network redundancy is by having more than one path between any two connected devices.

###### CSN-1.E.4: If a particular device or connection on the Internet fails, subsequent data will be sent via a different route, if possible.

###### CSN-1.E.5: When a system can support failures and still continue to function, it is called fault-tolerant. This is important because elements of complex systems fail at unexpected times, often in groups, and fault tolerance allows users to continue to use the network.

###### CSN-1.E.6: Redundancy within a system often requires additional resources but can provide the benefit of fault tolerance.

###### CSN-1.E.7: The redundancy of routing options between two points increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.

###### IOC-2.B.2: A strong password is something that is easy for a user to remember but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user.

###### IOC-2.B.3: Multifactor authentication is a method of computer access control in which a user is only granted access after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism, typically in at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know), possession (something they have), and inherence (something they are).

###### IOC-2.B.4: Multifactor authentication requires at least two steps to unlock protected information; each step adds a new layer of security that must be broken to gain unauthorized access.

###### IOC-2.B.5: Encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. Decryption is the process of decoding the data. Two common encryption approaches are: Symmetric key encryption involves one key for both encryption and decryption. Public key encryption pairs a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The sender does not need the receiver's private key to encrypt a message, but the receiver's private key is required to decrypt the message. (Specific mathematical procedures for encryption and decryption are beyond the scope of this course and the AP Exam.)

###### IOC-2.C.2: Keylogging is the use of a program to record every keystroke made by a computer user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords and other confidential information.

###### IOC-2.C.3: Data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified. One way that this can happen is through a rogue access point.

###### IOC-2.C.4: A rogue access point is a wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks.
