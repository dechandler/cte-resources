  description: Bits are grouped to represent abstractions. These abstractions include, but are not limited to, numbers, characters, and color.
- code: DAT-1.A.7
  description: The same sequence of bits may represent different types of data in different contexts.

##### DAT-1.B: Explain the consequences of using bits to represent data.
- code: DAT-1.B.1
  description: In many programming languages, integers are represented by a fixed number of bits, which limits the range of integer values and mathematical operations on those values. This limitation can result in overflow or other errors.
- code: DAT-1.B.2
  description: Other programming languages provide an abstraction through which the size of representable integers is limited only by the size of the computer's memory; this is the case for the language defined in the exam reference sheet.
- code: DAT-1.B.3
  description: In programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers limits the range and mathematical operations on these values; this limitation can result in round-off and other errors.

- code: DAT-1.D.4
  description: Lossless data compression algorithms can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data.
- code: DAT-1.D.5
  description: Lossy data compression algorithms can significantly reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approximation of the original data.

  description: The use of lists allows multiple related items to be treated as a single value. Lists are referred to by different names, such as array, depending on the programming language.
- code: AAP-1.D.7
  description: The exam reference sheet provides the notation [value1, value2, value3, ...] to create a list with those values as the first, second, third, and so on items. For example, § Text: aList ← [value1, value2, value3, ...] Block: aList ← valuel, value2, value3 creates a new list that contains the values value1, value2, value3, and ... at indices 1, 2, 3, and ... respectively and assigns it to aList. §§ Text: aList ← [] Block: aList ← creates a new empty list and assigns it to aList.
- code: AAP-1.D.8
  description: The exam reference sheet describes a list structure whose index values are 1 through the number of elements in the list, inclusive.
